# ProjectLife

ProjectLife is a learning project where I explore the Xamarin platform to create a UWP, Android, and ios app from one shared code library. The backend will be tied together using Azure, and local data storage for offline use.
Main premise of doing this is to firsly brush up on skills I do not get to use in my day-to-day job, and also to build an app that I can use to track my own New Year goals.
Hopefully I can also build up a journal of things I have learn a long the way.
